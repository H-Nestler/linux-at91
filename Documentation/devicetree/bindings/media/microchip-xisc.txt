Microchip eXtended Image Sensor Controller (XISC)
----------------------------------------------

Required properties for XISC:
- compatible
	Must be "microchip,sama7g5-xisc".
- reg
	Physical base address and length of the registers set for the device.
- interrupts
	Should contain IRQ line for the XISC.
- clocks
	List of clock specifiers, corresponding to entries in
	the clock-names property;
	Please refer to clock-bindings.txt.
- clock-names
	Required elements: "hclock".
	This is the clock that clocks the sensor controller, and is usually
	fed from the clock tree. It is used for the internal controller logic.
- #clock-cells
	Should be 0.
- clock-output-names
	Should be "isc-mck".
- pinctrl-names, pinctrl-0
	Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt.

Optional properties for XISC:
- microchip,mipi-mode;
	As the XISC is usually connected to a demux/bridge, the XISC receives
	the same type of input, however, it should be aware of the type of
	signals received. The mipi-mode enables different internal handling
	of the data and clock lines.

XISC supports a single port node with internal parallel bus.
It should contain one 'port' child node with child 'endpoint' node.
Please refer to the bindings defined in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

This endpoint has to be connected to a bridge that acts as a demux from either
a serial interface or acts as a simple direct bridge to a parallel sensor.

Example:
xisc: xisc@e1408000 {
	compatible = "microchip,sama7g5-isc";
	reg = <0xe1408000 0x2000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 56 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	clocks = <&pmc PMC_TYPE_PERIPHERAL 56>;
	clock-names = "hclock";
	#clock-cells = <0>;
	clock-output-names = "isc-mck";
	microchip,mipi-mode;

	port@1 {
		reg = <1>;
		xisc_in: endpoint {
		bus-width = <12>;
		hsync-active = <1>;
		vsync-active = <1>;
		remote-endpoint = <&csi2dc_out>;
		};
	};
};
